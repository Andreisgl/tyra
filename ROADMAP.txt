------------ Tyra's v2.0 roadmap to publish on GitHub ------------
- [General] Control generated id to avoid duplication. Maybe Just increment from 0? Add interface IIdentificable?
- [DMA] Check if all chain transfers have end tag!
- [General] Change libs of sample? (remove -lpng, -lz...), probably they are not required
- [General] Check all TYRA_ASSERT() if there are no asserts like (TYRA_ASSERT(!audsrv_load_adpcm(result, data, adpcmFileSize)))
because this lines will be removed on make-release. Only debug stuff should be checked in assert

- [General] All Copyrights to 2022
- [General] CI in Github via docker image
- [General] Add cpp lint checker in GitHub

- [Demo] Create cool demo which will show all features of Tyra

- [Tutorials] 1. Hello world! - explain init(), loop() and what should be inside them (every tutorial should be well commented!)

- [Tutorials] 2. 2D - explain beginFrame(), endFrame()

- [Tutorials] 3. Minecraft cube - explain this pipeline, and explain that there are many 3D pipelines

- [Tutorials] 4. Mesh rendering - explain staticPipeline, render .tyrobj file via Mesh class, explain that this is high-level 
abstract 3D object class, and what it have (animation etc)

- [Tutorials] 5. Manual rendering via staticPipeline - via Render3DBag (core.render()), render simple poly,
explain that this is lower-level abstract rendering, it have the all the features as Mesh rendering, 
because Mesh rendering uses only core.render()

- [Tutorials] 6. Animation in Mesh rendering rendering, explain the API

- [Tutorials] 7. Directional lights in Mesh rendering

- [Tutorials] 8. Render skybox, and show that stdPipOptions.noClipChecks must be set to false, to turn on clip algorithms (prevent glitches)

- [General] Check all left TODOs -> Github issues
