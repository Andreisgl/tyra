------------ Tyra's v2.0 roadmap to publish on GitHub ------------

- [General] CI in Github via docker image

- [Tutorials] 1. Hello world! - explain init(), loop() and what should be inside them (every tutorial should be well commented!)

- [Tutorials] 2. 2D - explain beginFrame(), endFrame()

- [Tutorials] 3. Minecraft cube - explain this pipeline, and explain that there are many 3D pipelines

- [Tutorials] 4. Mesh rendering - explain staticPipeline, render .obj file via Mesh class, explain that this is high-level 
abstract 3D object class, and what it have (animation etc)

- [Tutorials] 5. Manual rendering via staticPipeline - via Render3DBag (core.render()), render simple poly,
explain that this is lower-level abstract rendering, it have the all the features as Mesh rendering, 
because Mesh rendering uses only core.render()

- [Tutorials] 6. Animation in Mesh rendering rendering, explain the API

- [Tutorials] 7. Directional lights in Mesh rendering

- [Tutorials] 8. Render skybox, and show that stdPipOptions.noClipChecks must be set to false, to turn on clip algorithms (prevent glitches)

- [General] Check all left TODOs -> Github issues

- [General] Readme Credits: clipping, obj loader
